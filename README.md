    Mech My Day!

    by Jonathan Gover

    Use WASD to control the mech, and the mouse to fire.
    Left mouse click fires chainguns and lasers, right mouse click fires rockets.
    Rockets have limited ammo, but you gain more for destroying buildings.

    The object is to destroy all the buildings as quickly as possible.

    Created for the 72 hour game development competition, of which 24 hours were spent without access to a computer.

    Thanks to Duncan Stead for the music!
    and Rachel, who so kindly did level design at the last minute.
